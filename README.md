# spiral
## a robust robot framework... probably
### A collaboration between 5115 and 3793

### Goals
1. simplicity
2. efficiency
3. future-proof

It is effectively a command based rewrite including rewrites of some WPILib functions for speed, and utility additions. This allows for a plug-and-play experience for new or inexperienced teams, and will make debugging problems simpler for the more experienced.

README IS IN PROGRESS, AS IS THE REST OF SPIRAL
