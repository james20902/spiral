// example: talon dl on pdp 4 can 24 encoder motor
// this means there is a talon SRX left drive motor on the PDP slot 4 with CAN id 24, and the encoder device is integrated. you could do 2 3 after encoder for A at 2 and B at 3
// make sure to declare left drive motors, then right, and begin each group with the motor with and encoder
