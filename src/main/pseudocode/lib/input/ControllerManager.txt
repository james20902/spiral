Inputs
    None
Goals
    Manager for new implementation of controllers that initialize themselves and allow for hotswappable stuff so that we don't have a redo of one of 3793s DCMP matches
    Should deadzones be done in the manager, controller, or in the end?
Outputs
    Returns individual controllers if you ask politely
